# Vertical hydraulic gradients shift over 100 years
## A comparison of vertical hydraulic gradients from the early 1900s to 2010-2020 


## Purpose & Objectives 

The purpose of this project is to compare groundwater movement (vertical hydraulic gradients and artesian conditions) from the early 1900s to present day (~2010-2020). 


## Data Sources 

### Early 1900s Groundwater Data 

1) Early 1900s CV wells data: manually compiled by Jasechko lab (June-October 2021) 
  - Darton, 1905
  - Fuller, 1905
  - Fuller, 1906
  - Crider & Johnson, 1906
  - Veatch, 1906 
  
2) Mendenhall et al., 1916 (https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58923e21e4b072a7ac143c11)

3) USGS Groundwater Wells (See Rproject 'usa_groundwater_data' by Hilton for more details)


#### Early 1900s Groundwater Data Cleaning & Compilation 

Data Search

- USGS Publications Warehouse: https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/search?q=tennessee&year=
- Major aquifer systems in US targeted: Mississippi Embayment, Central Valley, High Plains 
  - Search by state, category year published, download as CSV and sort publications per state by year (earliest year first) 
  - Papers that contain table data of groundwater wells (not ancedotal in text) before 1907 were considered 

Data Compilation/Digitization 

- 5 early USGS publications were identified and assigned to student employees to digitize 
  - Darton, 1905
  - Fuller, 1905
  - Fuller, 1906
  - Crider & Johnson, 1906
  - Veatch, 1906 
- Data digitized and then checked twice by employee; final check conducted by second individual (Annette Hilton) 

Data Cleaning 

- All 5 documents were merged into one large dataset, keeping important information that was consistent across documents 
  - id 
  - county 
  - city 
  - specific_location 
  - township
  - range
  - section
  - latitude
  - longitude 
  - min_depth_ft 
  - max_depth_ft 
  - depth_sign 
  - depth_text 
  - min_height_water_ft
  - max_height_water_ft
  - height_water_text
  - remarks 
  - citation 
  
- No document originally included a lat/long: lat-long was calculated by: 
  - Geocode by Awesome Table Add-On in Google Sheets (where city, state was available)
  - Township, section, range only available--plotted in ArcGIS, lat/long taken from center of TRS
  - For wells where more "specific location" were available, lat/long offset calculated
